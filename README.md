<h2 id="how-to-run-locally">How to Run Locally</h2>

1.  **Navigate into this folder:**
    ```bash
    cd my-app-frontend
    ```
2.  **Install all required packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
The app will open in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:5173`. **Note:** For file generation to work, the backend server must also be running locally.

<h2 id="how-to-make-changes">How to Make Changes</h2>

-   **To Change Colors:** Edit the `theme.extend.colors` section in **`tailwind.config.js`**.
-   **To Change the Logo:** Replace the file in **`src/assets/`** and update the `<img>` tag in **`src/App.tsx`**.
-   **To Edit Forms, Buttons, and Page Layout:** The vast majority of the UI is controlled by **`src/App.tsx`**.
-   **To Edit Reusable Components:** Modify the corresponding files in the **`src/components/`** folder.
-   **To Change the Backend Server URL:** The `fetch` request URL is hardcoded in the `handleDownload` function inside **`src/App.tsx`**. Update it if your backend server address changes.
