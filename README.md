### ðŸŽ¨ How to Make Common Changes

#### **Changing Colors & Styles**
This project uses **Tailwind CSS**. The main configuration is in `tailwind.config.js`. You can change the primary application colors in the `theme.extend.colors` section of this file.


#### **Editing Page Layout, Forms, and Logic**
The vast majority of the user interface, including all forms, buttons, and state management, is located in one central file:
-   **`src/App.tsx`**: This is the heart of the frontend application.

#### **Reusable Components**
Smaller, reusable UI pieces (like buttons, inputs, icons) are located in:
-   `src/components/`
